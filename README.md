# Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Implementation

This project implements the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, a systematic exploration approach for language models to solve complex reasoning tasks through structured thought processes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run example implementations from the `examples/` directory

## Features

- Implements various search strategies (BFS, DFS, Beam Search)
- Flexible thought generation and evaluation
- Configurable parameters for different problem types
- Example implementations for various reasoning tasks

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from tot import TreeOfThoughts
from thought_generator import ThoughtGenerator

# Initialize ToT solver
tot_solver = TreeOfThoughts(thought_generator=ThoughtGenerator())

# Solve a problem
solution = tot_solver.solve(problem="Your problem description")
```
